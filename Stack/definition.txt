A stack is a type of linear data structure that stores data similar to how
data is stored in a list. In fact, two ways to implement a stack are by using
linked lists or by using an array/list. In my class in stack.py, I implement it
using a list. It's important to note that a stack is ordered as LIFO (last in
first out) or FILO (first in last out), which refers to the order that
elements are added to and taken from a stack. It's easy to visualize this
using a stack of books or plates, of which, normally the last plate added to a
stack is the first plate off of it. That's the same with this data structure.

Pros and Cons:
Methods to add and remove from a stack are very efficient, also a stack helps
manage data in a specific order. However, random access is not possible on
a stack.
