# Python-Data-Structures
### Basic data structures implemented in Python.
I am currently studying various data structures at school, and so I decided to implement some of them in python. Each folder in this project represents one data structure. In each folder there are four files. There's a file for the data structure itself, a tester file used to test/debug the project, an example file that shows the data structure in action, and a definition file which gives a brief definition of the data structure.
