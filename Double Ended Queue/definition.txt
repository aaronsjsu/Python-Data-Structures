A deque (double ended queue) is a type of linear data structure that is
essentially a queue that allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Thus,
a deque supports both stack and queue operations. In this file, I will
implement a deque using a doubly linked list.

Pros and Cons:
Methods to add and remove from a deque are very efficient, also a deque helps
manage data in a specific order. However, random access is not possible using
a deque.
