A singly linked list is a type of linear data structure that stores data
elements in a node. Each node in the linked list is linked by a pointer.
Each node points to the next node and is pointed to by the previous node
(except the head and tail nodes). A graphical representation would look like:

 -----     -----     -----     -----     -----
 | A | --> | B | --> | C | --> | D | --> | E | --> null
 -----     -----     -----     -----     -----

Where A is the head and E is the tail, and each box represent a node while
each arrow represents a reference/pointer to the next node.


Pros and Cons:
Linked lists are extremely efficient with insertion/deletion, but they
don't allow random access (elements can only be accessed sequentially).
Also, linked lists take up extra memory because each node not only contains
the data, but also a reference to the next node.
