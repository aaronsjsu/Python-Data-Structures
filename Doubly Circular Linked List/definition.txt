A doubly circular linked list is a type of a linked list in which all nodes
are connected to form a circle (there is no null at the end), and each node
contains two references, one to the previous and one to the next node. A
graphical representation would look like:

-----     -----     -----     -----     -----
| A | <-> | B | <-> | C | <-> | D | <-> | E | <--
-----     -----     -----     -----     -----    |
  ^                                              |
  |-----------------------------------------------

Where each box represent a node, each arrow represents a reference,
and both A and E point to each other (circular).


Pros and Cons:
This type of linked list has all the advantages of a basic linked list, with
the disadvantage being that each node requires extra space for the second
reference. Because this linked list is circular, any node can be used as a
starting point, which means we can traverse the entire list by starting
at any point. Because this is a doubly linked list, the list can be easily
traversed in reverse order. Also, because this is a linked list, insertion
and deletion are efficient, but random access is not allowed, since elements
must be accessed sequentially.
