A queue is a type of linear data structure that stores data similar to how
data is stored in a list. In queue.py I actually create a queue by using
a list. A queue is very similar to a stack, the main difference being how
data is retrieved. A queue follows FIFO (first in first out). It's easy to
think about this by thinking about a restaurant. Typically, the first
people to order are the first ones to get their food. That's how this data
structure works.

Pros and Cons:
Methods to add and remove from a queue are very efficient, also a queue helps
manage data in a specific order. However, random access is not possible using
a queue.
